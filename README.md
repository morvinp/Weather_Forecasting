# Weather Forecasting

This repository showcases a comprehensive project on weather trend forecasting using Python and Power BI. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and spatial analysis.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies to prepare the dataset for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA using Python and Power BI.
- Highlighted that heatmaps may not always be ideal for depicting correlations in datasets with values of varying scales.

### 3. Model Building
- Implemented three predictive models and identified LightGBM (LGBM) as the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

### 4. Advanced EDA & Anomaly Detection
- Performed country-specific anomaly analysis.
- Identified that the U.S. has a high anomaly count, suggesting the need for added randomness in its predictions, whereas Madagascar has only one anomaly.

### 5. Spatial Analysis
- Conducted geographic analysis to understand weather trends and anomalies across regions.

### 6. Feature Importance
- Evaluated feature importance to gain insights into key contributors to the model's predictions.

### 7. Results 
- Successfully trained 3 models for forecasting and here's the plot --
